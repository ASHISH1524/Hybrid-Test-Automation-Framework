# Java Test Automation Framework

This is a robust Java 11-based test automation framework designed for scalable, maintainable, and cloud-ready testing. 

It utilizes TestNG as the primary test runner and supports both local and LambdaTest cloud execution. 

The framework supports data-driven testing through multiple sources (OpenCSV, JSON, Apache POI for Excel) and integrates the Faker library for dynamic test data creation.

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASHISH1524/Hybrid-Test-Automation-Framework.git

cd Test-Automation-Framework
```

**Running Tests on LambdaTest:** 

```bash
mvn test -DBrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
```

**Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode:** 

```bash
mvn test -DBrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X
```


## Reports & Logs
- Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html.

The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.

## Logs:
Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory.
